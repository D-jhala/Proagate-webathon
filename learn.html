        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language HTML describes the structure of a Web page HTML consists of a series of elements HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content HTML elements
        are represented by tags HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page Progate, W3Schools and many other platforms would
        be very helpful and essential to learn HTML and CSS.

        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. The language
        was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17. C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. C++ is
        an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++
        is fun and easy to learn! As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa

    <br>
    <p> Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995. It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java. It is used for: Mobile applications (specially Android apps) Desktop applications Web applications Web servers and application
        servers Games Database connection And much, much more! Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.) It is one of the most popular programming language in the world It is easy to learn and simple to use It is open-source
        and free It is secure, fast and powerful It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers) Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs As
        Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.

    <br>
    <p>
        C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style,
        these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX. C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s. The
        language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). The UNIX OS was totally written in C. Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language. Most of the state-of-the-art software have been
        implemented using C. Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
